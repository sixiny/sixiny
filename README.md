<!--my introduction start-->
> Here is some of my self-introduction hahaha.

- 🔭 Now I am a graduate student. I may not be that good, but I have been working hard 🐌.
- 🌱 Have a public account with friends **[一颗程序树]**, welcome to step on.
- 🐢 My postgraduate research is extensive, including semi-supervised learning, domain transfer, domain generalization and prompt learning. However, I have not yet completed QAQ 😭. I hope the reviewers will be kind 🙉.
- 💝 PPersonally, I prefer to do back-end development. I like java very much. I don't know why, but I like this language very much. So in leisure time will learn some technology stack to enrich their own, the revolution has not been successful, comrades need to work hard 🏃
- ❤️ Personally, I think I am a sports boy, but I am only half good at what I am not particularly good at. I like badminton 🎾 very much, although I love it, I will beat CMH one day.
- 🐴 Come on **Yangsixin** is the best ！！！
- 📧 My email:**yangsixin1999@163.com**. Welcome to chat hahaha and find Github friends！！！！
